#  Taryns_cocktails
This is a work in progress app using flutter and Dart to connect to Cockail API found here https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php. 
The app randomizes cocktails and then shows the method and ingredients of the cocktail on click of the cocktail name. 

See the plan folder for wireframes of the app. 

## Getting started

Clone the repo by using command git clone
 https://github.com/tarynCodes/cocktail_app.git

Ensure all packages are downloaded by running the command `flutter pub get`

To view the app use command `flutter run` and choose your desired method to view the app. 

## About the App

The home page - if you click 'click for your next favourite cocktail' button this then brings back a random cocktail name that you can then click to go to its cocktail page and view ingredients, mesaures and method to make this cocktail. 

For future versions I would like to add the picture and video content to make the app more visually interactive.
